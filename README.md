# CHIP-8-Java
CHIP-8 Emulator in Java

A heavily broken WIP emulator for the CHIP-8 interpreted programming language / instruction set, created in Java. This is the first thing I've ever done relating to emulation, so I have no idea what I'm doing. :D

THINGS TO WORK ON:
Fixing opcode interpreters.
Rendering graphics.
Input.
Playing sound.
Everything else, probably.
