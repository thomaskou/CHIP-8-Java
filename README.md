# CHIP-8-Java
CHIP-8 Emulator in Java

A heavily broken WIP low-level emulator/interpreter for the CHIP-8 programming language / instruction set, created in Java. This is the first thing I've ever done relating to emulation, so I have no idea what I'm doing. :D

**THINGS TO WORK ON:**
* Fixing opcode interpreters.
* Game speed.
* Rendering graphics.
* Input.
* Playing sound.
* Everything else, probably.
